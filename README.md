"A project for cleaning customer data."
# Data Analyst Internship - Task 1: Data Cleaning

This project is a solution for the data cleaning and preprocessing task.

## Process Overview

The Python script `clean_data.py` was used to perform the following actions on the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset:

1.  **Renamed Columns:** Standardized all column names to a consistent, lowercase format (e.g., 'Annual Income (k$)' became 'annual_income_k').
2.  **Handled Missing Values:** Checked the dataset for any null values. None were found.
3.  **Removed Duplicates:** Checked for and removed any duplicate entries. None were found.
4.  **Verified Data Types:** Ensured all columns had the appropriate data type (e.g., 'Age' as an integer).

The final, processed data was saved to `cleaned_mall_customers.csv`.
